A [Giter8][g8] template for Scala.js projects, created by following the [official Scala.js documentation][scalajs-tutorial] with some tiny improvements.

The project is using only two dependencies (other than Scala.js): scala-js-dom and scalatest. You can easily remove them if you want.

Usage
-----
If you have [SBT][sbt] version 0.13.13 or later, you can simply run:

```
sbt new tues/scala-js.g8
```

It will ask you a few questions (project name, Scala version etc.) and create a new directory named after the project.

After generating the project, you may want to edit the following files:

- `src/main/scala/MainApp.scala`: contains a simple "hello world"
- `src/main/resources/index.html`: a minimal HTML page which loads the generated JavaScript automatically
- `build.sbt`: SBT build file, contains things such as library dependencies and a small snippet of code which generates `index-dev.html` (for use with `fastOptJS`) automatically based on `index.html`

The easiest way to build your project is:

```
sbt fastOptJS
```

You can then open `target/scala-2.12/classes/index-dev.html` (generated from your `index.html`) in your browser.

If you want SBT to automatically rebuild the project every time you change some files, run:

```
sbt '~fastOptJS'
```

Building with full optimization for production can be done with:

```
sbt fullOptJS
```

To use the fully optimized JavaScript you should open `target/scala-2.12/classes/index.html` (which is simply copied from your `src/main/resources/`).

Please consult [Scala.js documentation][scalajs-tutorial] for details.
